            <p>An ex-hitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters who killed his dog and stole his car.With the untimely death of his beloved wife still bitter in his mouth, 
]               John Wick, the expert former assassin, receives one final gift from her--a precious keepsake to help John find a new meaning in life now that she is gone. But when the arrogant Russian mob 
                prince, Iosef Tarasov, and his men pay Wick a rather unwelcome visit to rob him of his prized 1969 Mustang and his wife's present, the legendary hitman will be forced to unearth his meticulously 
                concealed identity. Blind with revenge, John will immediately unleash a carefully orchestrated maelstrom of destruction against the sophisticated kingpin, Viggo Tarasov, and his family, who are 
                fully aware of his lethal capacity. Now, only blood can quench the boogeyman's thirst for retribution.</p>
