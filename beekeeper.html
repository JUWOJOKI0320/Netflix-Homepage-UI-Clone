            <p>One man's brutal campaign for vengeance takes on national stakes after he is revealed to be a former 
                operative of a powerful and clandestine organization known as "Beekeepers." Adam Clay is a beekeeper, but someone very important to him is scammed and driven to harm. However, what these power and money hungry scammers don't know, is that Clay is an agent in a classified program called Beekeepers, and they underestimate how much of a threat he is. Adam sets out on a quest of vengeance, where he hunts and kills those responsible for the incident.</p>
