            <h1>Nobody</h1>
            <h2>2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+16 &nbsp;1h 32m</h2>
            <h3>Director: Ilya Naishuller <br> Main Cast: Bob Odenkirk(Hutch Mansell / Nobody)</h3>
            <p>A docile family man slowly reveals his true character after his house gets burgled by two petty thieves, which, coincidentally, leads him into a bloody war with a Russian crime boss. 
                Trapped in a mundane existence, Hutch Mansell, a glum, humble, workaday suburban father, is petrified when violent burglars break into his home, threatening his wife and children. 
                In the wake of this soul-scarring incident, one good deed and several broken bones--and teeth--later, suddenly, imperfect Hutch summons up the courage to stand up for himself, only to 
                find himself targeted by the murderous Russian drug lord, Yulian Kuznetsov, and his brutal henchmen. It seems that Mansell has a death wish; however, in this world, there are two kinds of people:
                wolves and lambs. The question is, which one is Hutch?</p>
